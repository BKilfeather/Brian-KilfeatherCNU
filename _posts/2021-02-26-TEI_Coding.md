# TEI Coding 
## The Yellow Wallpaper
Coding isn’t necessarily a part of my repertoire, however, Oxygen, an eXtensive Markup Language (XML), helped me finish this assignment easily. I edited 4 pages from Charlotte Perkins Stenson’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” by implementing the errors and markups provided in the google doc to Oxygen. The Yellow Wallpaper is about a woman who struggles with postpartum depression. Coding in general seems a bit daunting in the beginning as it looks almost like a new language. However, just like any language, starting to learn the foundation helps you to create a better understanding of what’s going on.

As a class, we were given different sections of the book to annotate and markup the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Initially, this was done manually through a google doc by learning what was in need of a markup in the text. For example, page beginnings, crossed out words, and em-dashes are all things that were used to put into the code. My first mark was in the first paragraph of the 16th page where Stenson stated, “This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had!” while having knew underlined. This process was repeated and implemented into an XML file in Oxygen.

I have used coding in an html document before this, but using another program makes everything seem different. Dr. Stover provided a clutch video that helped guide me through this assignment with ease. At first, I was stressed that I wasn’t able to copy and paste the tags into my document, but other than that I had no real issues. 

Overall, this assignment helped me excel in coding, DH, and the knowledge of Stenson’s “The Yellow Wallpaper”. Learning another program for coding and how it’s instrumental to markup was an enjoyable experience. In the future I will look forward to knowing that I have a basic understanding of how to code and markup properly.
