### Summary

The “Six Degrees of Francis Bacon” is a website that displays a collection of infamous scholars, philosophers, historians, and more. The purpose of the website is to guide viewers through shared networks from an individual or origin. For example, the viewer starts with Francis Bacon. If they type in King James into the shared network, they can compare the networks between the two. The website aims to show the viewer how these iconic historical figures connect by using the interoperability of the website with the goal of making an accessible network for scholars. Basically acting as an interactive library. The “Six Degrees of Francis Bacon” creates a tree of names and displays how you can get from one person to another through thier relationships. 

### How It Works

Initially, the first look at the website is a hive of bubbles in different sizes connected to each other with a few notable names in the bigger bubbles.

Reiterating on how the website works, you are able to click or type a name/groups in the top left corner. From there, a graph appears showing the relationship between the person you searched for and the individual you are trying to link them to. Then, the website provides a table to click with a list of their names, historical significance, birth and death date, and relationship. The website is very complex relative to its more or less simple goal of creating a web of people’s relationships. 

At first glance the operability of the website is overwhelming. Learning on your own how to operate the networking would be a doozy; luckily though there is a tutorial in the help tab. Because of how the hooke aesthetic is set up, the website in general slows down computers. It is also not available on mobile devices. It only works through a tablet or computer because it requires a wide view. Yet, this site seems more apt for people with more experience in DH technology, rather than a casual viewer.  

### Digital Humanities

The website itself is a prime example of digital humanities. The purpose of the website is to provide information to scholars and students causing it to be educational. The interoperability of the website and the technology allows its viewers to perceive history through interaction. This makes it an interesting way to learn. Not to say that everything digital is digital humanities, but the website is an incentive to learn about historical figures and their connections by paving the way of what technology can do moving forward for history and literature. 

### Code

Furthermore, the coding explanation goes into further detail in the about tab. The authors state that “the codebase for the site uses Angular, Ruby on Rails, and D3, is available in our Github repo.” It’s also stated that they used R code and used a SDFB Network repo. Listing the authors of the network interface code, current, and original site, the about page also shares their twitter handle @6Bacon and an explanation of the data. 

### Conclusion

In sum, the website is a great tool to gain information about historical figures and the connection between them. Although confusing, the tutorial does a great job on explaining how to guide you through the maze of names. One of the downsides is how slow this website runs depending on how you’re viewing it. All in all, a collaborative effort from the website's team and coders, led to the creation of a very unique way to interact with history all onto one screen.
