            The “Starkville Civil Rights” speaks on the civil rights struggles between the years 1960-1980. The main focus is on the stories of the trials and tribulations from the people of Starkville, Mississippi. Daaiyah Heard and her team gathered the  information for the project through oral history interviews and digitized archival documents pieced together by students at Mississippi State University. The project reflects the individual voices of the people that were raised in southern schools during the Jim Crow Era. The Website provides separate links to the history of the town, interviews, struggles and more.
            
            The website at first glance seems like any other historical article. However, when you scroll down, they provide links to different areas of the project labeled, The Place, The People, The Struggle, and Resources shown in the image below. The Place provides an in-depth summary of the background history of Starkville. This includes pictures, tables and an interactive civil rights map. The People tab links to interviews of Starkville natives. The team for the project made these interviews accessible by pressing the full interview button below their descriptions and brings you to the YouTube video of their story. The Struggle links to civil rights movement cases from the 1960s-1980s, these include; Segregated Education with Brown v. Board of Education, The MSU Story, Boycotts & Protests, and more. The Resources tab links to tools, research, and bibliographies provided by the directors of this project.
            
            This project clearly states how it is a digital oral and public history project. The “Starkville Civil Rights” is an impactful project that reflects on past moments in American history. Not by just highlighting the problems from the past, this website gives an introspective look into the lives of people who actually experienced these civil rights struggles. It’s important to learn from these stories to prevent them from happening in the future.
            
            This project’s layout is simple and concise; it is easy to navigate and every link is labeled with a small description of where it brings you. Also, in the image shown below, at the bottom of the project page they layout a timeline that’s easily accessible and provides events at a Regional/National, State, and Local level of civil rights movements. Each event is clickable and brings up a brief photo and description of what happened during that period. One problem is that the interactive map in The Place tab is zoomed out to all of Mississippi when almost all the marked areas are inside of Starkville. Instead of a Google maps feature, I feel like they could have just created a smaller map of where these civil rights movements occurred.
            
            In conclusion, the “Starkville Civil Rights” provides a great narrative of the stories and local activism in Starkville, Mississippi. The website itself is relatively simple and easy to access for all viewers. Although there are some difficulties, the project provides helpful information through interviews, maps, and a timeline. By enlightening the public with the trials and tribulations of Starkville, Mississippi natives, the project gives opportunity to amplify the voices of the past.
